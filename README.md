implementation of the paper
Conversion of Continuous-Valued Deep Networks to Efficient Event-Driven Networks for Image Classification

run the code in the following order

1. cnn.py
    this code will train a continuous-valued neural newtork
    and then it will save the weights and normalization factors for SNN
2. snn.py
    test SNN
